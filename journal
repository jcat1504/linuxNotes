Had trouble on Git where it didn't recognize the branch I was working on and my file wasn't showing in the repo. Realized I was working with two different commit histories.

Had a pretty busy day running errands all day, along with packing but got some research done: 
So working on another ticket...trying to set up a node js environment where Twilio will be able to send sms feature through node instead of bash, that way I can test with mocha
https://www.twilio.com/blog/how-to-send-sms-node-js
^^this could be the answer

### 6.15.2021
- I think I somehow accomplished the ticket successfully which was to implement Twilio text feature through node.js.
- Though at first, I wrote out a different file in node, which was implemented successfully...I just couldn't figure out how to run a shell script inside the node env
- I was thinking out loud and figuring out if it is remotely possible to call the function in my node file and execute it that way? 
Just the callWeather function and placed in a JS function to run in my node file..is that what we are looking to do?
But that would be like mixing two different things together - a bash function and javascript file, so that is extra work?
- Instead, I installed the shelljs module in my node environment, and called the shell script that way. it is just two lines and it worked out fine. I get text messages and 
script runs well. there is more to do, however

### 6.16.2021
- Finished last ticket which was to run my live weather script on shell script validator. Fixed up the errors, which were small and simple
https://www.shellcheck.net/

### 6.17.2021
-Something happened when I was editing my script in the validator that threw everything off. for some reason, the script ran but wasn't showing all of the weather forecast. and couldn't even detect my city
-so I created a diff file pretty much like the original one, and it worked just fine

### 6.25.2021
Lately, I've been working on tickets for Corey and trying to translate a bash script to javascript code. Calling weather forecast through sms utilizing Twilio. Taken awhile 
but I can get a sense and idea how it translates to...out of what I DO know. Last night, I had a call with Corey about communicating as an engineers as well as the do's/don'ts when it 
comes to working with others. I also found this and I'm going to finish this tomorrow or Sunday
