### 6.9.2021
Had trouble on Git where it didn't recognize the branch I was working on and my file wasn't showing in the repo. Realized I was working with two different commit histories.
Solved it with this answer:

### 6.14.2021
Had a pretty busy day running errands all day, along with packing but got some research done: 
So working on another ticket...trying to set up a node js environment where Twilio will be able to send sms feature through node instead of bash, that way I can test with mocha
https://www.twilio.com/blog/how-to-send-sms-node-js
^^this could be the answer

### 6.15.2021
- I think I somehow accomplished the ticket successfully which was to implement Twilio text feature through node.js.
- Though at first, I wrote out a different file in node, which was implemented successfully...I just couldn't figure out how to run a shell script inside the node env
- I was thinking out loud and figuring out if it is remotely possible to call the function in my node file and execute it that way? 
Just the callWeather function and placed in a JS function to run in my node file..is that what we are looking to do?
But that would be like mixing two different things together - a bash function and javascript file, so that is extra work?
- Instead, I installed the shelljs module in my node environment, and called the shell script that way. it is just two lines and it worked out fine. I get text messages and 
script runs well. there is more to do, however

### 6.16.2021
- Finished last ticket which was to run my live weather script on shell script validator. Fixed up the errors, which were small and simple
https://www.shellcheck.net/

### 6.17.2021
-Something happened when I was editing my script in the validator that threw everything off. for some reason, the script ran but wasn't showing all of the weather forecast. and couldn't even detect my city
-so I created a diff file pretty much like the original one, and it worked just fine

### 6.25.2021
Lately, I've been working on tickets for Corey and trying to translate a bash script to javascript code. Calling weather forecast through sms utilizing Twilio. Taken awhile 
but I can get a sense and idea how it translates to...out of what I DO know. Last night, I had a call with Corey about communicating as an engineers as well as the do's/don'ts when it 
comes to working with others. I also found this and I'm going to finish this tomorrow or Sunday

### 7.13.2021
I think I might have found the source for implementing weather script with JS code:
https://medium.com/@giuliano/build-a-weather-by-sms-service-with-twilio-and-nodejs-36826c903eb3

### 7.16.2021
- Came up with a function that can not only send sms, but also catch weather api and send the body as a message
- However, the weather results only pop up in the terminal, so I need to figure out a way to send this through sms and I am good 


### 7.17.2021
- didn't do as much as I wanted to, but I solved a couple of things!
I made the app a little more interactive. at first, I was only able to grab information on the weather in Long Beach, but now I made it so I can search up
weather in a specified city. otherwise, my default input is long beach
-a few complications. I realized my node was not updated enough to implement yargs. yargs is more of a pirate themed interactive tool on the cli - which has us
declare variables from the command line. understandably, there are environment variables I can declare, but I needed to declare the object externally with js in order
to make it work.
-...then somehow, I wasn't able to work with yargs bc I needed to update node. so I tried, but my permission was denied and I had to install nvm..then somehow it hiccuped
and my cache got cleared out. I had to install yargs, twilio and npm all over again but I am glad I caught that quick.

### 7.22.2021
-had a little trouble installing ngrok but I'm sure I will figure it out

### 7.30.2021
-Submitted PR of recent API server files and readme, wrote up rough draft of blog post, studyed a little on system design

###8.2.201
-Read up on what makes a "good" readme file (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) and put that to good use for my recent repo
-Studied on systems design a little bit
-Waiting on PR review

##8.4.2021
Having a bit of trouble putting together a GET request on POSTMAN from Twilio API. It's not pinpointing to the right files, I don't think. I might have
not plugged in the correct route because it's refusing to get me a stable connection
https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-resource


##8.6.2021
-Successful GET request. List all messages organized by date on Postman
-Turned off both global proxy config and system proxy
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44945663/postman-error-tunneling-socket-could-not-be-established-statuscode-407

8.10.2021
Thought process:
I will want to create an environment to make requests in and create a environment variable called message. Then make first request to the 
weather API then use the Postman scripting after to set the message environment variable based on the response from the API. Finally set up the second
request to Twilio and set the value for the "Body" parameter to be {{message}} environment variable.

8.11.2021
One step closer to the solution - I am able to extract json data from api but don't know how to set that as an environment variable yet.

- droplets are linux based virtual machines that run on top of virtualized hardware
-basic droplets are good enough for web hosting, staging environments and low intensity compute needs.

INITIAL SERVER SETUP WITH UBUNTU
1. logging in as root
- remember to create ssh key(https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/)
- connect droplets with SSH(https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/)
2. creating a new user
3. granting administrative privileges
4 set up basic firewall
5. enabling external access for your regular user


8.16.2021
I am able to extract and parse JSON data, and console.log the response body but still don't know how to save and use it as an environment variable. I know how
to do it for my API, and other factors, but not the whole weather just yet.

8.17.2021
CREATE POST REQUEST - edited routes in get request to proper environment variables
- in tests: extracted data from api and parsed it into environment variable called responseBody
  - weather forecast stored in env variable and I console.log everything
  -then in body(form) I use postman scripting to call weather in env variable
  after... I create post request to twilio. in body(form) I add in {{responseBody}} which is weather data and sending the req will go to my mobile
  
  -the thing I had most trouble with is extracting data and setting it as env variable through postman
  -it was properly parsing the responsebody and setting it as a variable. then learning to put that in the response body in postman
  i thought it'd be more complicated with code but it was getting accustomed to tools.
