- Figured out how to print weather script through terminal
- Had a task to print script through sms using Twilio
  - Signed up for free acct and purchased number with credits 
- Tried to put the pieces together... how exactly do I run the script to display weather thru sms?
  - Created a function, learned how to call said function in script and condensed everything
- Showed some unnecessary gibberish in output and sms(I am guessing its the styling output code in bash) and fixed MOST of it
