* Given a private key to log in but had trouble on putty

  ​		<i> >(says no supported authentication methods(privateKey))</i>

* learned to save private key on putty, log in as root user

* puttygen is where you generate and load public and private keys



#### ch. 1

* update packages installed in the system

<b>root user = super user</b>

* benefits of creating a personal account: can use same commands as root/same power but generally denied or require special command: sudo



#### GRANTING ADMINISTRATIVE ACCESS TO USER

* <b>add new user</b>: usermod -aG sudo <username>

* <b>exit + login as new user</b>: though doesn't work for me on putty < <strike>...permission denied</strike>

	* so I just switched users and input password

* <b>accessed server, changed root users password, update system packages</b>
